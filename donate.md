## Step 2 Fill out the survey
Fill out one (very short) survey for each device being donated.
## Step 3 Donate
Wrap the completed survey around your device, and drop it in the box.
# Donating FAQs
## Which device models can be donated?
We will take any make or model.
## What if the device is damaged?
We accept donations in any and all conditions.
## Will my data be safe?
We will be performing a factory reset on all donated phones. You can also do this yourself before donating. Instructions for performing a factory reset yourself can be found here:

## What if my phone isn't used for the project?
We will recycle all unused donations.

# About the Project
Smartphones require a lot of energy to manufacture, and we go through them quickly. As many as **150 million** devices are thrown out each year in the U.S. alone. Options for dealing with discarded phones are also limited: The reselling market is small, and smartphone recycling is energy-intensive and hazardous. 

Our project goal is simple: Get more useful work out of the devices we've already manufactured. While a phone with a cracked screen might not make a good personal device, it can still act as a computer. 

We have shown that a small smartphone-based datacenter has the potential to provide similar functionality to exising cloud computing platforms.

## Towards a 100-smartphone datacenter
Expanding the project to include more (and more diverse) devices is essential in order to evaluate our proposed solutions at scale. Over the next year, we aim to build out a 100-smartphone datacenter, built from donate smartphones and providing a computing platform for researchers at UCSD.
